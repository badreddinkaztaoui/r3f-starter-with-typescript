# R3F Starter with TypeScript

<img src="/screenshot.png" alt="Example image">

This project is a starter template for creating [React Three Fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber) (R3F) applications with TypeScript. It includes all the necessary configuration to get started with R3F and TypeScript, including:

- A basic R3F scene with a spinning cube
- A basic Webpack configuration with support for TypeScript, CSS and file loading
- A basic development server with hot-reloading

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/badreddinkaztaoui/r3f-starter-with-typescript.git
cd r3f-starter-with-typescript
npm install
```

Then, start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the development server at `http://localhost:8080/`.

## Building for Production

To build the application for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a production-ready bundle in the `dist` directory.
